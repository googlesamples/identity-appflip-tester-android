# App Flip Test Tool for Android

[![ci][1]][2]

The App Flip Test Tool is designed to verify your Android app's integration with
App Flip for Google account linking.
This app simulates the intent triggered by Google mobile apps when App Flip is enabled.
Use this tool to debug issues you may be experiencing with App Flip and account linking
in your Android app.

The App Flip Test Tool can be used to test with the Google
[App Flip Sample for Android](https://github.com/googlesamples/identity-appflip-android),
or your own Android app with an App Flip account linking integration.

## Prerequisites

1. Android Studio installed (version 3.0 or above)
1. Android device or emulator (API 26 or above) with your target app installed

## Getting started

1. Import the project into Android Studio
1. Open `res/values/strings.xml` and edit the following values:
   - `package_id`: Application id of your app
   - `intent_filter_name`: Intent action configured with App Flip for your app
   - `target_app_signature`: SHA256 fingerprint for your app's signature
     ([how do I find this?](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/client-auth))
   - `client_id`: Client id configured with App Flip for your app
   - `scope`: Optional additional auth scopes array configured with App Flip for your app
1. Build and run the app on your target device

## Usage

Launch the test tool application on your device, and tap **Try Flip**.
The device should launch your Android app to complete the authorization flow.
After completing user authorization, the test tool will display any `auth_code`
or `error` messages in the log.
